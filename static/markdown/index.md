# Welcome to G Cluster
### Introduction
This cluster contains a login node and thirty computing nodes named gXX (XX ranges from 01 to 30). It is built for large-scale-parallel-float-computing with NVIDIA GPU, which is very common in Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning research and applications. CentOS is the base opearating system for all computers in this cluster. While, the OS for users is Ubuntu 18.04LTS, which is achieved by the Docker technique.

Before start to use it, please **Keep in mind**:

```The Cluster is NOT your personal computer. It is for all of us!```

In order to keep our cluster ready for use for all of us at anytime, you are restrict to do something that you may do everyday on your personal computer. However, as you will see in this doc, all these restrictions should NOT limit your work, as long as you change your usage habits a bit and understand basics of linux operating system.

Wish all of you have fun with our G Cluster!
